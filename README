This repo is just a test case for a bug in GitHub Pull Requests.

Normally, if branch A is 2 commits ahead of master, and branch B is
2 commits ahead of A and hence 4 commits ahead of master, and you
have a Pull Request to merge B into master, the PR will list all 4
commits, but then if you merge A into master (and push), then the PR
will do the right thing and update to show the only 2 commits that
B is ahead of master.

However, it appears that if the tip of B is timestamped after the
commits in A that were merged and pushed to master (e.g. due to a
rebase), then the PR to merge B into master will incorrectly
continue to list all 4 commits, even though 2 of them are already
on master.

This bug is exhibited in

as you read these very words.
