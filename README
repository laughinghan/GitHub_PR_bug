This repo is just a test case for a bug in GitHub Pull Requests.

Normally, if branch A is 2 commits ahead of master, and branch B is
2 commits ahead of A and hence 4 commits ahead of master, and you
have a Pull Request to merge B into master, the PR will list all 4
commits, but then if you merge A into master (and push), then the PR
will do the right thing and update to show the only 2 commits that
B is ahead of master.

However, it appears that if the tip of B is timestamped after the
commits in A that were merged and pushed to master (e.g. due to a
rebase), then the PR to merge B into master will incorrectly
continue to list all 4 commits, even though 2 of them are already
on master.

This bug is exhibited in
https://github.com/laughinghan/GitHub_PR_bug/pull/1
as you read these very words.

If you are experiencing this bug, there's a workaround: find a way to
git push -f the problem branch (the branch for which a PR lists too
many commits). For example, you could git checkout the problem branch,
and do:

    git branch TEMP
    git reset --hard HEAD^
    git push -f
    git merge TEMP
    git branch -d TEMP
    git push

Unless you have a branch named TEMP, this should fix the issue and
leave everything as it was before. (If you have a branch named TEMP
and can't deal, ask an adult for help.)
